## Uberon

Uberon is an anatomical ontology that represents body parts, organs
and tissues in a variety of animal species, with a focus on
vertebrates. It has been constructed to integrate seamlessly with
other ontologies, such as the OBO Cell Ontology, the Gene Ontology,
Trait and Phenotype ontologies, as well as other anatomical ontologies.

The ontology includes comprehensive relationships to taxon-specific
anatomical ontologies, allowing integration of functional, phenotype
and expression data. The figure above shows taxon-centric anatomy
ontologies along the bottom axis; domain specific ontologies on the
right hand side; orthogonal ontologies on the left axis.

Currently Uberon consists of over 10000 classes representing structures
that are shared across a variety of metazoans. The majority of these
classes are chordate specific, and there is large bias towards model
organisms and human.

## Contact us

The best way to make contact is through the obo-anatomy list

You can also contact any members of the core developer team directly

## Term Requests

Our preferred way of receiving requests for new terms or changes to the ontology is by creating a new issue using our issue tracker

 * [uberon issues on github](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/new)

However, this requires that you sign up for a github account.

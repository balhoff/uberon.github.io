## Contact us

You can email the Uberon developers directly at:

 * Chris Mungall - cjmungall AT lbl DOT gov
 * Melissa Haendel - haendel AT ohsu DOT edu

Whilst we welcome any and all email, we strongly encourage community
participation through our github issue tracker or our community
mailing list (see below).

You can also find us on twitter, [@uberanat](https://twitter.com/uberanat).

## Mailing List

The obo-anatomy mail list is a community listserve for all anatomical ontologies

 * [subscribe via google groups](https://groups.google.com/group/obo-anatomy)
 * [subscribe via sourceforge](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/obo-anatomy)

## GitHub Tracker

Our preferred way of receiving requests for new terms, changes to the
ontology or questions is by creating a new issue using our issue
tracker:

 * [Current list of issues](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues)
 * [Submit a new issue](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/new)

Note that interaction through the tracker requires that you sign up
for an account on [github](http://github.com) - this does not take
long, and you may find this useful later on anyway, as more and more
scientists are using github for managing their projects and data.

We welcome any kinds of input on the tracker; if you are having issues
with either the content of the ontology, or the technical aspects of
the download files, don't hesitate to use the tracker.

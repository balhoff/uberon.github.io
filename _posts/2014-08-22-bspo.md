title:  "JBMS Paper: Nose to tail, roots to shoots: spatial descriptors for phenotypic diversity in the Biological Spatial Ontology"
summary: "Spatial terminology is used in anatomy to indicate precise, relative positions of structures in an organism. While these terms are often standardized within specific fields of biology, they can differ dramatically across taxa. The Biological Spatial Ontology standardizes the description of spatial and topological relationships across taxa to enable the discovery of comparable phenotypes."

Our paper on the Biological SPatial Ontology (BSPO) has been
[published in JBMS](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/34).

The BSPO is an ontology complementary to Uberon describing regions,
axes and relations for connecting organism parts spatially and
topologically across all forms of life.

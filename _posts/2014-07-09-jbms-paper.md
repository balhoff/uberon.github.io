Our paper on the unification of multiple vertebrate anatomy ontologies
has been [published in JBMS](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/21).

This paper describes the decision to merge efforts and combine forces
by unifying the following anatomy ontologies:

 * The Teleost Anatomy Ontology (TAO), covering bony fish
 * The Amphibian Anatomy Ontology (AAO)
 * The Vertebrate Skeletal Anatomy Ontology (VSAO), covering all aspects of skeletal structures in vertebrates
 * The vertebrate Homologous Organ Groups (vHOG) ontology
 * Uberon

All these ontologies were combined into Uberon. As a result, the
curation efforts of multiple different groups, including Phenoscape,
Bgee and FEED are focused on one resource, and data from these
projects can be integrated together.

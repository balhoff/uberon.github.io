The NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures
(LINCS) project aims to create a network-based understanding of
biology by cataloging changes in gene expression and other cellular
processes that occur when cells are exposed to a variety of perturbing
agents, and by using computational tools to integrate this diverse
information into a comprehensive view of normal and disease states
that can be applied for the development of new biomarkers and
therapeutics.

This project recommends the usage of Uberon and the OBO Cell Ontology
for describing organs, tissues and cells for annotating reagents and
assays.

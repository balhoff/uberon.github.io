The Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) project identifies
properties of regions of the genome such as chromatin structure,
protein-binding and methylation. Many of these properties are specific
to cell types and tissues, so the ENCODE project uses ontologies to
organize and query this information. These ontologies include the
Cell-type ontology (CL) and Uberon.

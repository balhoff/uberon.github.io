We are pleased to announce an Uberon workshop, satellite of the
Biocuration2014 meeting, to be held in Toronto, Canada, on the 5th and
6th April 2014.

Uberon is an integrated cross-species anatomy ontology, representing a
variety of entities classified according to traditional anatomical
criteria such as structure, function, and developmental
lineage. Uberon provides a necessary bridge between anatomical
structures in different taxa for cross-species inference, allowing
integration of model organism, human, and comparative morphology data.

This workshop will be user-oriented, and will be devoted to
introducing and training participants to the use of Uberon. For more
information and schedule, please see the [workshop website](http://edu.isb-sib.ch/course/view.php?id=167)


Attendance is limited, and places will be allocated on a first come,
first served basis. The estimated registration fee is C$200. The
registration page is available at:

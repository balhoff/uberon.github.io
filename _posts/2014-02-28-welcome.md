Welcome to the new Uberon website! We're still adjusting the new
platform (thanks Jekyll and GitHub!), things may be a little buggy,
but thought it better to press ahead as it's a significant
improvements on the old one.

Some useful links:

 * [Old website](http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/UBERON:Main_Page) - content still being moved
 * [Uberon wiki](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/wiki/Manual) - we hope to have better integration between website and the wiki in future
 * [Overview](/about.html) - project overview
 * [Adopters](/about/adopters.html) - friends of Uberon
 * [Downloads](/downloads.html) - Download the ontology

We've also added a search bar, courtesy of OntoBee, together with
different browsing options, available from the top menu bar.

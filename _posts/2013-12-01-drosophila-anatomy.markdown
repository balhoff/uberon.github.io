The Drosophila anatomy ontology (DAO) has been around for around
twenty years, which is getting on a bit. You might think such a crusty
old beast may be a little set in its ways, unwilling to adapt to
new informatics landscapes and new biological discoveries.

However, you would be wrong. The DAO has actually pioneered the way in
many respects. Whilst many bio-ontologies were stuck in an old editing
paradigm, the DAO was an early adopter of the OWL technology stack,
and pioneered the way for other ontologies such as the GO to
follow. The challenges of using the DAO to represent fly brain
neuronal connectivity knowledge led to the construction of new
relationships types that have been adopted in Uberon.

Costa et al have published a long-overdue description of the DAO:

_Jounral of Biomedical Semantics_ 2013, 4:32  

They describe the 8000 classes in the DAO, and the methods they used
to refactor a twenty year old ontology into a modern OWL ontology.

Figure 4 from the paper shows the distribution of content in the DAO

The majority of classes are in the nervous system branch, reflecting
the detailed curation of nervous system cells performed as part of the
Virtual Fly Brain (VFB) project.

The VFB provides an excellent example of how a well-axiomatized
ontology can enhance a database system. If you haven't tried the VFB,

## Uberon Guide

Uberon can be used as a standalone ontology, but is best used in
combination with other ontologies, in particular anatomy ontologies
focusing on the biology of a specific species or taxon. Uberon also
makes use of a number of advanced ontology constructs. These can be
ignored for some applications, but other applications will benefit
substantially from them.
